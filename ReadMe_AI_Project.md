# Conclusion

We have created two files- one comprising the Random Forest approach and the other comprising the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) approaches. The detailed conclusions for each methodology can be found in their respective files. 



To further understand the performance of our model, we have compared it with a few different models from kaggle. 

**Note: The difference between PyTorch and Tensorflow is inconsequential in our project, and hence we utilized PyTorch.**

The majority of the models implemented the CNN approach. The main difference between the models were the number of convolutional layers used. Among our approaches, the CNN model utilizes 3 layers, the ResNet18 model utilizes 18 layers, and the ResNet50 utilizes 50 layers whereas other models typically utilized 4 to 5 layers. Additionally, a similarity across all the models, including ours, is the usage of the Adam optimizer.
